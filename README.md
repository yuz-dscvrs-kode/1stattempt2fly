this is my very first attempt in connecting my github account, creating a repository, and then linking it to my git folder inside my redhat box running in vmware workstation from my win11 machine named trainingwheels

i'm starting to appreciate git and linux because of this, i wish we had git during college days when my group created projects in vb and c#, instead of comparing code using usb sticks. tech has gone a long way from cassette tapes, vhs and floppy disks.
